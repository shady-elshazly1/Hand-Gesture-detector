# Hand Gesture Detector using Python

## Overview

This Python project utilizes computer vision techniques to implement a Hand Gesture Detector. The system is capable of recognizing various hand gestures and interacts in real-time with the user.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone (HandTrackingModule)
- NumPy
- [Any other dependencies]

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-detector.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The application will use your webcam to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes the OpenCV library and cvzone's HandTrackingModule for efficient real-time hand gesture detection.

- **Gesture Actions**:
  - Fist: Prints "hi" to the console.
  - Peace Sign: Prints "Peace" to the console.

- **Network Communication**:
  - Sends hand landmark data over a UDP socket to a specified address (`127.0.0.1:5052` in this case).

## Configuration

- Adjust the configuration settings in the `main.py` file as needed.
